## 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendations

### 📊 Insight 1: Traffic is increasing, but conversion rate stays low
- Visits and pageviews increased from January to March 2017, but the number of transactions remains low.
- ✅ **Recommendation:** Optimize product pages and checkout flow. Run A/B tests to identify friction points in the conversion funnel.

### 🌐 Insight 2: High bounce rates from top traffic sources
- Direct and organic traffic have high visit volumes but also high bounce rates.
- 🔧 **Recommendation:** Improve landing page relevance for each source and add engaging CTAs (calls to action) to reduce bounce rates.

### 💰 Insight 3: Most revenue comes from a few top sources
- Revenue is heavily concentrated in sources like Google and YouTube in June 2017.
- 📈 **Recommendation:** Allocate more marketing budget to high-performing channels and build targeted campaigns around them.

### 🛒 Insight 4: A small set of products generate most of the revenue
